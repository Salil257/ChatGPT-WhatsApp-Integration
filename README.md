# ChatGPT-WhatsApp-Integration
ChatGPT integration with the WhatsApp API
This project is a chatbot integration with WhatsApp API to automate responses by bridging the communication gap.
The core functionality of the solution is implemented through a callback endpoint developed in Spring Boot Java. 
The endpoint acts as a bridge between the chatbot and WhatsApp, enabling the automation of responses.
This endpoint is designed to handle incoming requests from WhatsApp and route them to the appropriate handler, which
then formulates a response and sends it back to the user. This ensures that customers receive prompt and relevant responses
to their queries, improving the overall user experience.
To ensure security, the solution is deployed in a Docker container with SSL implemented using Nginx reverse proxy. This approach
offers several benefits, including easy deployment, portability, and enhanced security. The use of SSL guarantees secure communication
between the chatbot and WhatsApp API, reducing the risk of data breaches or unauthorized access.

Overall, this project showcases an elegant and sophisticated solution for chatbot integration with WhatsApp API. The combination of
technologies, such as Spring Boot Java, Docker, and Nginx reverse proxy, offers an efficient, secure, and scalable solution for businesses 
looking to improve their customer experience through chatbots.
